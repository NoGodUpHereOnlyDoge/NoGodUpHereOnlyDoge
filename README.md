- 👋 Hi, I’m Kris
- 👀 I’m interested in Music Production, Motorcycles, Rock and Roll, Pop-Punk, Electric Guitars, and of course typing hundreds of lines of code into a screen ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Java, JavaFX, MySql, Node.js, Python (because my friends need help with it a lot), and how to get through life doing the things that I like.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything, if I know how to do it.
- 📫 How to reach me: GitHub, gonna keep this profile unlinked from all my social media for a while, an Off Grid profile if you will, I was never here.
